What is binary Search tree(BST)?

    Binary search tree is formed such that value of root is greater than every node in left subtree and less than every node in right subtree.
    Same followed by each subtree.

What is inorder transversal of a binary tree?
    In case of inorder transversal, first left is processed and then root is processed and then right subtree is processed. In case of BST it 
    prints the nodes in increasing order.

    algorithm:

    void dfs(node* root){
        if(root==NULL)return;
        dfs(root->left);
        print(root);
        dfs(root->right);
    }


what is preorder transversal of a binary tree?
    In case of preorder transversal, first root is processed then left subtree is processed and then right subtree is processed. Just like
    depth first search algorithm.

    algorithm:
    
    void dfs(node* root){
        if(root==NULL)return;
        print(root);
        dfs(root->left);
        dfs(root->right);
    }

what is postorder transversal of a binary tree?
    In case of postorder transversal, first left subtree is processed and then right subtree is processed and then finally root is processed.

    algorithm:

    void dfs(node* root){
        if(root==NULL)return;
        dfs(root->left);
        dfs(root->right);
        print(root);
    }

what is level order transversal?
    Level order transversal of a tree is such that first all the nodes at a particular height are processed starting from root and then following levels are processed till leaf is reached.
