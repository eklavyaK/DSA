->A weighted graph is a graph whose edges has been assigned some weights

->Neighbour of a vertex or node is the node which is directly connected to it with an edge

->Degree of a node is the number of neighbours.

->A graph is complete if every node has n-1 degree

->In a directed graph, the indegree of a node is the number of edges that end at
the node, and the outdegree of a node is the number of edges that start at the node.

->A graph is bipartite if it is possible to color its nodes using two colors in such a
way that no adjacent nodes have the same color. It turns out that a graph is bipartite
exactly when it does not have a cycle with an odd number of edges.

->An important class of graphs are directed acyclic graphs, also called DAGs. Such
graphs do not contain cycles, and many problems are easier to solve if wemay assume
that this is the case. In particular, we can always construct a topological sort for the
graph and then apply dynamic programming.

->Successor Graphs: Directed graph where outdegree of each node is 1, also called functional graphs
