->A weighted graph is a graph whose edges has been assigned some weights

->Neighbour of a vertex or node is the node which is directly connected to it with an edge

->Degree of a node is the number of neighbours.

->A graph is complete if every node has n-1 degree

->In a directed graph, the indegree of a node is the number of edges that end at
the node, and the outdegree of a node is the number of edges that start at the node.

->A graph is bipartite if it is possible to color its nodes using two colors in such a
way that no adjacent nodes have the same color. It turns out that a graph is bipartite
exactly when it does not have a cycle with an odd number of edges.
